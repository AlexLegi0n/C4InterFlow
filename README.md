# Vision ðŸ’¡
Transform the landscape of **Application Architecture** by bridging the **gap** between **Architecture Model** and **Code**.

# Mission ðŸŽ¯
 Provide a **comprehensive** Application Architecture **toolchain** for IT Professionals to
 1. Effortlessly express Application **Architecture as Code** (AaC)
 2. Automatically **generate** Application Architecture **diagrams** from AaC
 3. Intuitively **analyse** Application Architecture by issuing simple **queries** against AaC
 
# Overview

**C4InterFlow** is a comprehensive **Application Architecture** focused **toolchain** designed for anyone in an organisation, who wants to either **contribute** to (or just to **explore**) the Application Architecture **documentation**.  

## Example use cases
**Software Engineers** and **Architects** contribute by populating an **Architecture Catalogue** and by generating (or writing manually) **Architecture as Code** (AaC).  

**Product Owners**, **QA** and any other team members, on the other hand, explore the Application Architecture by **browsing** various **automatically generated diagrams** (e.g. C4, Sequence etc.) as well as by **querying** Application Architecture (e.g. to find dependencies).  

**Architects** and **Product Owners** contribute by adding Business Processes to the **Architecture Catalogue** or by writing **Business Processes as Code** manually.

**Operations** team members explore the Business Processes by **browsing** various **automatically generated diagrams** 



# Capabilities
C4InterFlow offers versatile capabilities including:
- Manual creation of **Architecture as Code** in **C#** or **YAML**
- Automatic generation of Architecture as Code in C# or YAML from **.NET (C#) source code** or from **Excel/CSV Architecture Catalogue**
  - **NOTE**: Automatic generation of Architecture as Code is also possible from the source code in **other languages** as well as from **Infrastructure as Code** (IaC) 
- Generation of **C4 Model** and **Sequence** diagrams of various **scopes** (e.g. all Software Systems, Software System, Container, Interface(s), Business Process etc.) and at different **levels of details** (e.g. Context, Container and Component)
  - Diagrams can be generated in a variety of **formats** including **Plant UML** (.puml), **SVG**, **PNG** and **Markdown** (.md files with embedded PNG diagrams)
  - With a bit of additional custom automation, these diagrams can be published to other platforms e.g. **GitHub Pages**, **Confluence** etc.
- Advanced **querying** of Architecture as Code, with support for **JSON Path-like** syntax, to uncover dependencies or to perform any other AaC analysis
  - **Custom** diagram generation based on **query results**
- **Business Process** description through **Activities** and **Interfaces** utilisation
  - Manual writing of **Business Process as Code** in **C#** or **YAML**
  - Adding and editing Business Processes via the **Excel/CSV Architecture Catalogue**
    - **Automatic generation** of **Business Process as Code** in C# or YAML from **Excel/CSV Architecture Catalogue**
- **Command Line Interface** (CLI) used for automating AaC **generation**, AaC **querying** and **diagrams generation**

# Getting Started

- Learn more on our [wiki](https://github.com/SlavaVedernikov/C4InterFlow/wiki)
- Choose a strategy for Architecture as Code generation.
- Get your teams to own their Architecture by expressing it in **YAML** or **C#** code
  - Use automation to bring AaC from multiple Repos into a centralised Architecture Repo and use it to generate diagrams for the whole Enterprise.
- Utilize a set of [CLI capabilities](https://github.com/SlavaVedernikov/C4InterFlow/wiki/Command-Line-Interface-(CLI)) via C4InterFlow CLI App
- Expose CLI capabilities via your own C# Console Application.
  - It's a good way of extending it with custom commands.

# System Requirements

- Java PlantUML .jar (embedded within the project).

# Support

- For help or to report issues, please raise [GitHub issues](https://github.com/SlavaVedernikov/C4InterFlow/issues).

# Contributions
